# DigitalReportCards
Digital report cards archive

Only a few classes

I have successfully modernized and significantly improved the way we keep our report cards by creating a digital archive. Managed the development of the project from the idea until the final product, led the team of 4 people. The program was developed in C# and MS SQL Server. I am proud to say that my original idea is now really put to practice and used in Mathematical Grammar School in Belgrade and it is in the process of expanding to other schools or universities.
